# NativeInteractiveChessboard
An interactive chessboard made only with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## About
As a chess player I wanted a simple interactive chessboard to show positions and use it for learning or teaching others about chess.
I wanted it to be made lightweight and with what a browser natively supports.
You can [try it online](https://interactivechessboard.nikosnikitas.repl.co/) or download the files from here and run it on your browser.

## Usage
You can drag and drop the pieces around and study your positions or empty the board and make your own positions.
